Summer of 1987.

Eugene plays the flute. (Exceeding well, I might add)
His parents are just so proud of him, but his peers on the other hand...

They called him crabby pants. Because on a fishing trip one time,
the bully of the class dumped a bucket of crabs in his
pants. One crab severed an artery in his left testicle. So they also
call him uni-ball.

Uniball Crabby Pants.

And then there was Shelly. The girl of his dreams.

Shelly was super kind but liked to pinch a lot. Turns out Shelly was a crabby 
crab. What the bully didn't know, is that Eugene was a crab-o-phile. Eugene 
loved everything about crabs. The taste, the way they walked sideways, and theirmeaty insides. Eugene loved Shelly sooooo much one day he invited her for dinnerbut before dinner he offered Shelly a dip in his large dutch oven. Shelly got 
quite comfortable. The water started out cold and slowly warmed to a boiling
point.
